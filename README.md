So you've finally installed macOS onto your desktop/laptop/smart fridge but you look towards the menubar and see a Bluetooth icon yet no wifi to go with. You immediately bolt to the Settings pane and see no wifi option and wonder where you may have gone wrong in your install.

Well you search for more definitive answers and finally drop onto this page hoping to clear things up
